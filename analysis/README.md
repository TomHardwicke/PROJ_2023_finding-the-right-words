This folder contains all of the analysis scripts used in the project. 

To reproduce the analyses reported in the manuscript, run the analysis.qmd script (.qmd is a Quarto file). analysis.qmd calls upon functions.R, raw_to_primary.R, and primary_to_processed.R. This will generate the analysis.html file which you can open in a web browser.

simulations.qmd runs the simulations that were included in the Stage 1 Registered Report.
